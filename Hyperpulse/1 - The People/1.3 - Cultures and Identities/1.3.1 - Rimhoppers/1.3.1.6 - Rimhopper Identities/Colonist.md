__Choose one of the following Keywords:__
*Barn Builder* - You have spent long days helping your colony build infrastructure, as such you know how to better build a structure in ways that reduce the time needed for completion. If you are part of a building crew, reduce the work time of any building your crew works on by 2 hours, to a minimum of 1 hour.

*Reson Trapper* - Using Reson Traps is second nature to you, to the point where you can squeeze the largest amount of reson and elevium you possibly can from them. Any Reson Trap related paraphernalia you have or operate will collect the same amount of Reson-Elevium Dust in half the time as one not owned or operated by you.

*Abstinent* - You have weathered seasons where your basic needs were left wanting and survived through all of them, due to this, your body has adapted to hold back exhaustion and hunger for a little while more than your comrades. You have one extra day before you become Hungry and one extra day before you become Tired.

*Rim Naturalist* - You are well familiar with the weird biospheres that surround the Rims. Thanks to that, you can infer one ability or property (E.G.: Attacks, Keywords, poisonous...) of any Non-Sapient Creature, plant/plant-equivalent, or fungi/fungi-equivalent you encounter in your travels without the need to roll tests. Any other insight requires you to roll a test under Worldshaper discretion.
