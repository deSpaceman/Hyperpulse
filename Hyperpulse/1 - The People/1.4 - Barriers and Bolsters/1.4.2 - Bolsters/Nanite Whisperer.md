___
### Nanite Whisperer
__Type:__ Bolster

In your travels, you have found a cache of progenitor nanites and, either by accident or on purpose, you have been able to decipher their inner workings, allowing you to command them to help your cause.

During a Rest, you may command your nanites to heal 2 HP you or one of your fellows has lost. If you have eaten during this Rest, you may heal 2 HP from three Creatures, excluding yourself, or heal 4 HP from one Creature, but, if you choose to do so, you will not Heal this Rest.

Nanite Whisperers normally have visible sections of their body turned into beautifully intricate nanite hives, those are pretty resistant and seldom break. The people of Selenia treat Nanite Whisperers with a degree of positive superstition and good omens, as their healing powers are helpful in times of need.
