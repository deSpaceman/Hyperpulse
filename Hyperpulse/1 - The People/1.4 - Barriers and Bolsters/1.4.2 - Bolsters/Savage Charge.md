### Savage Charge
__Type:__ Bolster

Charging at foes is in your genetics, you are made out of pure muscle, sharp claws, and menacing teeth after all.

If you use the Charge Maneuver, add Lesser Guts to the list of Keywords of the Weapon/Spell you use. If the Weapon/Spell already has has Lesser Guts or Guts, move it one level up (E.G.: Lesser Guts becomes Guts). If the Weapon/Spell already has Greater Guts, gain Advantage 1.

Ovlan that have particularly savage charging patterns typically accrue nicks on their claws, chips on their teeth, and damaged feathers or scales. While other sapients of the galaxy may not know what this means, other Ovlan will typically be intimidated by you.
