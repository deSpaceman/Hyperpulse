### Veilrad Poisoning
__Type:__ Barrier

A poorly understood condition caused by a poorly understood phenomena. Veilrad Poisoning is caused by the otherworldly bursts of energy created inside the Grav-Torques used to purify Aldstone, the fuel used in Pulse Drives.

Individuals with Veilrad Poisoning suffer with frail bodies (Reduce your maximum Body from 10 to 8) and foggy minds (Reduce your maximum Mind from 10 to 8).

A crust of shifting not-colors forms on the area that received the blast, replacing tissue, organic or otherwise, forming intricate fractal patterns. Sensory parts, such as eyes or mechanoreceptors function normally even if completely converted into veilrad crust. People tend to avoid individuals that suffered Veilrad Poisoning, with the reasoning behind it changing from area to area of the galaxy, it can be simple superstition to all out ableism. There is no known treatment for this kind of condition.
