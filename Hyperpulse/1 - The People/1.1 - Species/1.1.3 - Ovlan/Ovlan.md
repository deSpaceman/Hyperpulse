# Ovlan

![[ovlan, by Meow.png]]

## Great Beasts, Valiant Warriors
Theory has it that the Ovlans evolved from beings that have found themselves in the top of the food chain for millennia in their origin biosphere. This is supported by the fact they are hyper-carnivores, gifted with powerful tracking senses and, akin to Humans, have tremendous hardiness, although it is more about resisting damage than being generally die hard.
As such, Ovlan clans, from primitive times up until today, fight over pastures and land to tend to their vast cattle. As they progressed, Ovlani society was molded and forged into a honorable warrior culture and the fighting, for the fortune of future Ovlan generations, became somewhat of a ceremonial practice, with martial arts displays taking the place of senseless slaughter.

## Extreme Dimorphism
The two Ovlan sexes, Acair (which is typically equated to male) and Setair (which is typically equated to female), share only the same basic body plan in common as they are, in every sense, different from each other. Setair Ovlan are at most 1.6 meters tall, have short beaks, long canines, 4 ears, long arm, tail and head feathers and are speculated to have lived in packs, meanwhile Acair Ovlan are at most 2.5 meters tall, have long beaks, two layers of serrated teeth, 2 ears and 2 mechanoreceptors, short feathers overall and are speculated to have been lonely apex predators. To further this division, their population is divided in a 1:6 Acair to Setair ratio.
