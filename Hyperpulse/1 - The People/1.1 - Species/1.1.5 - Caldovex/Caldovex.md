## Brilliant Minds, Fearful of Standardization
The Caldovex are widely regarded as the smartest species to ever fly their ships among Selenia's stars. This is, as peculiar as it sounds, normally attributed to the fact that the Caldovex utterly abhor the concept of pure, sanitized, inconsiderate standardization. Meaning members of their people, specially in their Coreworlds, have this widespread culture of sharing and discussing their views on subjects with any and all, seeking to avoid bubbles and echo chambers.
Among their rank and file, their biosuits are adorned with the most varied layouts, natural colors, ornamental growths, clothes, jewelry and even synthetic parts, to the point that even two biosuits made to serve the same purpose will not look the same. This philosophy spreads even to their military, with soldiers given only a few limitations and guidelines when growing their biosuits, constructions, with Caldovexian cities looking like colorful mix and matches of solids and spirals, and, as expected, art.

## Hivemind Terror
This fear of standardization comes from the ancient times of the Caldovex people: a relic of the Progenitors, called the Brain of Xior, ran amok, and started to mentally enslave Caldovexian individuals to hiveminds of its creation. The few Caldovexes who remained independent took up arms against the hiveminds and succeeded to free their comrades, but not without tremendous trauma to their collective psyche as, even today, they look at hiveminds with distrust and avoid the erasure of individuality whenever possible.
