# Human



## Origin-less Wildcards
Curious, brave, and somewhat reckless, Humanity is a strange people that have long lost the knowledge of their origins. Seemingly holding no record of their past, be it their original planets or their ancestry. Humans travel around the galaxy in enormous nomadic fleets, covering long distances and spreading among the stars.
Due to this disconnect with their cultural origins and their widespread presence, Humans serve as Selenia's wildcard, quickly adapting to any culture or situation they find themselves, they seem to thrive and find opportunity in places where other species would ignore at best or find their end at worst. This has earned them a place in the Rims, making them the bulk of galactic civilization in the frontiers.

## Boundless Creativity
Humans are within the ranks of the most creative species on the galaxy. Jury-rigging is almost second nature to them and even waste can be of use to their fabricators. Of course, this amount of imagination has other implications beyond just funny utilities and prone-to-breakdown-but-doesn't-for-some-reason engineering: Humans tend to learn things with ease when they have someone to copy the actions related to a certain subject and extrapolating from there, making them one of the most potent force of creation in current day galaxy.
