Manual System Breaching (MSB Hacking) - Fast, but needs external information like passwords or external help like Codebreaker Codexes. The amount of traces it leaves behind varies on the type of hacking, with Info Extraction leaving none at all.

Virtual Drone Breaching (VDB Hacking) - Slow, as the Virtual Drone needs some time to process defenses and deactivate them. Only leaves the Virtual Drone as a trace, which can be left on the system, undetected for years depending on the use and type of the network.

Codebreaker Codex - Instantaneous, but leaves extreme amounts of traces, like Vulnerability Latches (programs that make it easier to do MSB Hacking at a later date), 50 to 100 obfuscated interface logs, and vestigial programs. The point of the obfuscated interface logs is to give enough time to the owner of the device that was used to extract or inject data to get as far away from the crime scene as possible.
It takes 3 hours to manually deobfuscate a log entry and 6 hours to do it via Virtual Drone. If someone is to acquire the Codebreaker Codex used to do the obfuscation, they need 1 hour to deobfuscate all logs.
