# Arvox

## Destined Seekers of Harmony
The Arvox are a blessed people, their Coreworlds are littered with the remnants of Progenitor knowledge caches and among one of those, there was a song, which many to this day interpret as a prophecy. The so called Erka-Ley (roughly 'Seeker's Peace' in the Starvaran dialect of Selanct), or The Grand Harmony, as it is known in Phoneticon, talks about a chosen people destined to bring harmony and peace to the galaxy, which the Arvox believe is them.
This has lead to a precarious relation between the Arvox and the other peoples and groups of Broken Space, as they use the Erka-Ley as prerogative to interfere in affairs from beyond their Coreworlds. This righteousness has also caused stress in the social fabric of Arvoxar society, with many skeptics moving away from Arvoxar Cores and into the Rims, where their voices are more heard and they are free from dogma and arrogance.

## Chameleons and Diplomats
Arvox have chameleonic abilities, changing their colors and even some parts of their morphology to help them communicate ideas and feelings. This is, of course, used to its full potential, from leisure to work to ceremony, every Arvox has dominion over their chameleonic properties and their diplomats and envoys use it as a compliment to their arguments with devastating effect in discussions.
