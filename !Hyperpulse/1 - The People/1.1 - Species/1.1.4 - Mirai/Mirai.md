## Fantastic Machines
The Mirai are an artificial people evolved from one of the synthetic biospheres found in forgotten corners of Selenia. As beings of such nature, they have somewhat of reputation as mysterious and exotic creatures and are treated with variable amounts of superstition and reverence where ever they go, much to both the horror and comfort of many Mirai.

## Respect, Loyalty and Friendship
The Mirair people have a strong sense and need of companionship, they assigning high value to their friends, machine or otherwise, and are an unwavering force of loyalty and support, attempting to make sure their friends turn into their best selves, for better or for worse. To betray one's trust is treated in a way most religions would treat a sin, the offender is treated like an exile and the news of the transgression spreads like wildfire on Mirai communities, effectively turning a once friendly population into enemies in a few rotations.
