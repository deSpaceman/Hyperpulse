__Choose one of the following Keywords:__
*Poly-Proficient* - Either by the power of cybernetic implants, genetic editing or just shear luck, you have the amazing capacity to store knowledge in a locked down state and retrieve it with some preparation. While Resting, you may choose to forgo healing and instead pick an Expertise Knowledge listed under General Knowledges at Novice level. This Knowledge remains with you until you decide to pick another Knowledge using the same process.

*Efficiency Training* - You are trained to maximize the efficiency of every resource you have at your disposal. All Consumables that have a given amount of uses have one extra use.

*High Speed Calculator* - Your brain, either by cybernetics or by sheer training, is an extremely fast calculator that can rival targeting computers. When manning the weapons of a vehicle/spaceship, shooting with a ranged weapon, or throwing any object, gain Advantage 2 when doing so. You may also use this for math problems.

*Interface Jack* - You have a CadeNet interface jack built-in using cybernetics. It fits in a Codex Port and, while connected to an Intranet via the jack, you gain Advantage 4 on any tests done to interact with the contents of said Intranet. Just be careful, this type of connection may leave you exposed to the Intranet's defenses in more ways than one.
