### Mercenary
	A path mostly started in the late teenage years, mercenaries are typically Rimhopper youngsters that have rebelled, stealing or working their way to a reliable weapon and, in some cases, a ship of their own. After that, they become soldiers, technicians, diplomats, bounty hunters, and any other walk of life their contractors need, granted there is enough Mint on the table.
	It is common for mercenaries to work together, being part of a larger company. That being said, a beginner without a veteran to take them under their wing is most often than not alone, fending for themselves until they find an accepting group of freebooters or found their own.

__Choose one of the following Keywords:__
*Diehard* - You are hard to be killed, extremely hard. If you Collapse due to you HP being reduced to any point between 0 and -3, you instantly stabilize. Further more, attempts to stabilize you do not suffer disadvantages, save situational ones.

*Double Tap* - You have trained to be able to squeeze two shots using your weapons. Treat all pistols and rifles that lack the Burst Fire or Multishot Keywords as having the Burst Fire at second level (so Burst Fire 2).

*High Noon* - You are a trained pistol duelist. Weapons with the Point-Blank Keyword have the effect of the Point-Blank Keyword extended to 5 Gridspaces instead of merely adjacent.

*Long-Range Assassin* - You know how to squeeze the most damage out of your high caliber weapons, especially against lightly armored targets. Weapons with the High Caliber Keyword have their Weapon Power doubled against targets that are either armor-less or are wearing armor with the Trailblazer or Concealed Armor or Keen Meditation Keywords.
