### Mercenary
	"The hired guns of the galaxy are, more often then not, rebel rimhopper youth that worked or stole their way to a reliable weapon. After that, its services until they can buy a ship of their own."
	
	Soldiers, technicians, diplomats, among other things on the hire, mercenaries are anything their contractors need, granted there is enough mint on the line. Mercenaries typically make companies to support each other while travelling from system to system and carry weaponry to protect themselves from the forces of the wilderness and from people who see them as an obstacle in front of their objectives.
	Mercenaries can also be refereed to as Bounty Hunters, depending on their occupation and region of the galaxy someone is in.
