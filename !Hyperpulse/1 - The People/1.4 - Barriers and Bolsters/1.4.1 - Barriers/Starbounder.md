### Starbounder
__Type:__ Barrier

Planetside life is not for you. The atmosphere feels too thick, small gravity well changes makes you nauseous, or the prospect of mud, dirt, and grime unnerves you. Doesn't matter, you aren't cut to go below the ionosphere of any planet, really.

Starbounders gain Disadvantage 2 on Focus Rolls every time they are inside the gravity well of a planet, planetoid, or moon.

__Effect Value:__ Mild
