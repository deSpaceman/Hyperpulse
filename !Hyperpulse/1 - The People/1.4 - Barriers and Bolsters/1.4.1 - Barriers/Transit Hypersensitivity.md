### Transit Hypersensitivity
__Type:__ Barrier

Pulse Transit immerses its passengers in a marvelous symphony of not-sensations that pleases the senses and offers a feeling of unparalleled freedom... for everyone but you. You suffer from what is classified as Transit Hypersensistivity, the not-sensations assault your senses, blinding your taste, deafening your vision, overwhelming you completely.

Individuals with Transit Hypersensistivity will typically harm themselves during Pulse Transit, trying to tear off their skin or screaming until their throats sore and their voices dwindle away. Whenever you enter Transit, roll a Focus test with the difficulty equal to the amount of light years you are travelling in real space divided by two, rounded down.
If you fail, roll Body, take the amount of Physical Damage equal to Successes.
