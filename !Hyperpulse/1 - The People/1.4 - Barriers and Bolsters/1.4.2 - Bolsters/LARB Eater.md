LARB Eaters, as people with this condition are known, have deep, shimmering purple leylines running through their fur, making them hard to miss. This condition is legendary and, within any area with considerable Ellitran presence, most people will have heard about it, making it rather hard for a LARB Eater to take advantage of it.
