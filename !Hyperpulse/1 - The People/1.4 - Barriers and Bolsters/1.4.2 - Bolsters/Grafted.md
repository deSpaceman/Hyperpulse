### Grafted
__Type:__ Bolster

Due to a plurispecies parenthood program, experimentation, or just plain weirdness in you family tree, your body and genetic structure have been altered from birth, causing you to be chimeric.

Under Worldshaper discretion, pick a Keyword from a Keyword list of a Sapient that is different from yours, add that Keyword to your Keyword list. If the Worldshaper judges your choice in need of balancing, they may add a Keyword perceived as negative (E.G.: Frail, Mute...) to your Keyword list.

Societies with a focus on purity of form will treat Grafted with disdain, an afront to nature born of hubris. While pluralist communities will either treat them well or all out objectify a Grafted, the latter much to the Grafted's dismay.
