___
### Jury-Rigging Mastery
__Type:__ Bolster

You have innate mastery over jury-rigging, as such, the creation of bubblegum-spit-and-tape cartoony items is just second nature to you. Of course, this has some limitations, you know for sure you can't simply make a reactor using this talent, and it's probably by experience.

During Rest, granted you have eaten, you may forego healing and instead use material you have on hand and a Tool to craft an item, under Worldshaper discretion and granted you follow a few a rules:
- The item must be of Small or Medium size. If the item is Medium, it may have or Tool Power or Weapon Power or Shielding Power, this, as well as their values, is under Worldshaper discretion;
- The item gains the Makeshift Keyword on creation, there is no way to remove it;
- The item must not be a proper piece of equipment (E.G.: Rimhopper Gear, Industrial Alloy Sword, Neo-Archivist's Gizmo);
- The item may have up to two appropriate Keywords, under Worldshaper discretion.

While Human communities are used to tomfoolery brought to day-to-day life by jury-rigging, other Sapients are not and, at best, will give someone with Jury-Rigging Mastery puzzled looks while they wield their contraptions. At worst, law enforcement may get involved.
