### Skirmisher
	  Even in peace, the galaxy is a dangerous place: beasts, warbands, raiders, and entities filled with ill will lurk, waiting to pounce on unfortunate souls. You are not an unfortunate soul.
	  You are a Skirmisher, someone skilled in the art of combat and fluent in the language of violence, taking the aggressiveness of the galaxy and responding in kind. Those who walk this trade are mercenaries, soldiers, and settlement guards, as well as pirates, brigands, and tugs.
